Hi, I'm Petar. I am a software developer based in London.

When I'm not working I am day-dreaming of travelling the world and owning a little wood workshop. Currently trying to learn Spanish. For the 5<sup>th</sup> time.

You can get in touch with me at **pgyurov93** at **gmail** dot **com**

## Education

### Royal Holloway, University of London (2012 - 2015)

**BSc Theoretical Physics** <cite>&mdash; 1<sup>st</sup> Class Honours (1:1)</cite>

For my major project I simulated a [Josephson Bifurcation Amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect) with
a side exploration into the [Nyquist–Shannon Sampling Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem). Simulation written in C++ and data visualisation with Python.

## Work

### Keen AI (10/2021 - Present)

**Technical Lead**

I am working on a variety of different projects, from object detection to aid efforts against Ash dieback disease to segmentation models used in corrosion assessment in steelwork. Concurrently developing our KAI platform that pieces some of this data together.

### The Big Wild (07/2021 - 02/02/2022)

**Machine Learning Developer** <cite>&mdash; C++, dlib, Python</cite>

I helped The Big Wild prototype an object detector and landmark detector for polar bears which is part of a bigger pipeline that will eventually be able to distinguish individual polar bears using face detection. The aim is to tackle the difficulties faced in polar bear tracking by providing a less invasive and less resource consuming alternative.

**Founder, Full-Stack Developer** <cite>&mdash; Python, Flask, AWS, ReactJS, PostgreSQL</cite>

Makely is a 3D printing platform that connects everyday people to 3D printing enthusiasts and hobbyists, allowing them to print their ideas with virtually zero knowledge of the tech. I've currently put the project
on pause. If you are interested in being a co-founder please get in touch.

### Splash Damage (08/2017 - 08/2019)

**Backend Engineer** <cite>&mdash; Python, Flask, Golang, C#, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL</cite>

Developed the backend for the PC game Dirty Bomb and an another unannounced project. The live-service nature of the games required the backend(s) to be flexible, with low overhead on new features and reliable scaling.

Improved the player sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier. Prototyped an analytics pipeline to handle high-throughput events for all of the company's titles.
