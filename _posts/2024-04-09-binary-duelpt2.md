title: "No Database No Retention No Party"

One month ago I wrote this article [You don't need a database, a queue, a distributed system: Go is enough.](https://simonedutto.github.io/2024-03-09/binary-duel) and I posted it on HackerNews.

The result was *interesting*: in fact it generated quite a bit of discussion and a lot of people decided to play with [Binary Duel](https://binary-duel.com).

# The Good

![Number of games](/assets/images/binary-duel/bn-number-of-games.png)

At a certain point, there were from 80 to 150 contemporary games and everything was good: no errors, the Golang backend was behaving in the best way. ( ðŸŽ‰ wohooo ðŸŽ‰)

I was right, what an engineer!

# The Bad

After this initial boom, few people decided to re visit the game (approx 10 a day).

# The solution

The solution is quite trivial: we need a db, we need login, we need a leaderboard, we need a way to incentivize competition between users.  
And that is exactly what we have done!
And again, Golang comes with a special treat:

_You don't actually need any dependency to do what you want, you can just code it._

Here is how you can implement a simple route cache (in memory):

```golang
type CacheEntry struct {
	cachedResponse interface{}
	t0             time.Time
}
var routeCache map[string]CacheEntry
if cEnt, ok := routeCache["<cache-key>"]; ok && time.Since(cEnt.t0) < TTL {
    // return response cached
} else {
    // produce response
    routeCache["<cache-key>"] = value
}
```

Here is how you can implement a ticker to bulk save games and assign points in the database
```golang
go func() {
    for {
        PersistGamesAndAssignPoints()
        time.Sleep(CLEANING_WINDOW_SECONDS * time.Second)
    }
}()

```

I am having so much fun using this stack and implement it all in this artisanal way. And I am looking forward to the moment the scale will force me to rewrite it all!


Will all of this manage to increase the retention? 
  
Do you have any idea or comment to improve [Binary Duel](https://binary-duel.com)?
